# Pixel Manipulation-Based Image Encryption Tool 🛡️🖼️

The **Pixel Manipulation-Based Image Encryption Tool** is a web-based application designed to secure images through advanced encryption techniques. Using XOR encryption and pixel swapping, this tool allows users to protect their images with a unique key or seed, making visual data unreadable without the decryption key.

This project is built using **Python** (Flask), **PIL** (Python Imaging Library), and **Bootstrap**, ensuring a smooth user experience, fast processing, and secure encryption.

## Features 🚀

- **XOR Encryption**: Uses a bitwise XOR operation to scramble image pixel values, making them unreadable without the decryption key.
- **Pixel Swapping**: Randomly swaps pixels within the image, further complicating the encryption.
- **Web-Based Interface**: User-friendly interface to easily upload, encrypt, and decrypt images.
- **Customizable Key/Seed**: Users can input a custom encryption key or seed for enhanced security.
- **Fast Processing**: Efficient image manipulation to ensure quick encryption and decryption.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Flask, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.
- **Secure Image Sharing**: Ideal for secure transmission of images, digital watermarking, and privacy protection.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python**: Programming language used for backend logic.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework to handle HTTP requests and serve the web application.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Python Imaging Library used for image processing (e.g., loading, modifying pixels).
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework used for creating the responsive user interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling for the web pages.

## How It Works 🔐

1. **Upload Image**: Users upload an image file they wish to encrypt.
2. **Enter Key/Seed**: Users provide a key or seed that will be used for encryption.
3. **Encrypt Image**: The image is processed using XOR encryption and pixel swapping techniques to secure the image.
4. **Download Encrypted Image**: Users can download the encrypted image.
5. **Decrypt Image**: To view the original image, users input the same key/seed to decrypt it.

## Installation 📥

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KashifMalik777/PRODIGY_CS_02.git
cd PRODIGY_CS_02-main
```

### Install Dependencies

Use `pip` to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following dependencies:

```
Flask==2.1.2
Pillow==8.4.0
```

### Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Flask app:

```bash
python pixel_manipulation.py
```

This will start a development server. By default, the app will be available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Usage 📷

1. **Upload Image**: Click the "Choose File" button to upload the image you want to encrypt.
2. **Enter Key**: Enter a unique key or seed (alphanumeric characters) for encryption. This will ensure that the encryption is unique and secure.
3. **Encrypt**: Click the "Encrypt" button to process the image and apply encryption.
4. **Download**: Once encryption is complete, download the encrypted image file.
5. **Decrypt**: To decrypt the image, upload the encrypted image, input the same key used for encryption, and click "Decrypt."

## Example Workflow ⚙️

1. User uploads `image.jpg`.
2. User enters a key: `123`.
3. Tool encrypts the image using XOR and pixel swapping.
4. Encrypted image `image_encrypted.jpg` is available for download.
5. User later uploads `image_encrypted.jpg` and enters the same key (`123`) to decrypt it and recover the original image.

## Security Considerations 🔒

- **Key Safety**: The security of the encrypted image depends heavily on the strength and secrecy of the key/seed. It is important to keep the key private.
- **Encryption Strength**: The tool employs basic XOR encryption and pixel manipulation, which is suitable for casual image protection. However, for high-security needs, consider using more advanced cryptographic methods.
